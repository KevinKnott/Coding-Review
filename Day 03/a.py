#  Basic Calculator: https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/
# Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

# Initial thought is to create a dfs where you have the value of left + 1 + right


class initial():
    def calculate(self, s):
        return
