# Score Card
# Did I need hints? Y
# I went to a very similar solution first however I tried using a list as an inbetween
# Did you finish within 30 min? Y
# Was the solution optimal? Y although my first solution had added complexity since My thought process wasn't quite completed
# Were there any bugs? N
# I didn't have any big bugs but using non local within nested functions tripped me up because I didn't remember that it was needed
# Also nested functions get a bit tricky
#  3 4 4 2 = 3.25
