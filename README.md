# Coding-Review
This repo will be for tracking of my progress at improving my basic coding skills to compete in Google Kick Start and similar styled competitions.

My goal is to go through the following list that I have pulled from leetcode and practice my problem solving skills in the following manner.

<ol>
<li>Review 5 problems</li>
<li>Spend 30 minutes trying to solve</li>
<li>Rate performance and place problems back into list in difficulty based of rating</li>
<li>Repeat until comfortable</li>
</ol>

You can view this list [here](https://www.notion.so/a41b4ff9be814387b5ab56a31275772d?v=e823a3de036d4ea48b392eccc25803d5)
