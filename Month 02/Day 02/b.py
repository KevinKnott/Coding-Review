# Basic Calculator: https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/

# Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().


class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        return
