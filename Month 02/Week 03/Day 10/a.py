# Diameter of Binary Tree: https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
# The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
# 5 2 4 2 = 3.25
