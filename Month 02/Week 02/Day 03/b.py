# Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

# You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.
# Return the number of connected components in the graph.

class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges) -> int:
        return

# Did I need hints? Y
# Did you finish within 30 min? Y
# Was the solution optimal? Y although I messed up the thought process of how to solve the problem
# Were there any bugs?  I didn't really have any bugs
#  2 3 3 5 = 3.25
