# Reverse Linked List II: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/

# Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: ListNode, left: int, right: int) -> ListNode:
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
