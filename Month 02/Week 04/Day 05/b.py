# Verifying an Alien Dictionary: https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/

# In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words, order: str) -> bool:

        return
