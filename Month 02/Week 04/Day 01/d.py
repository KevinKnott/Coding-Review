# Regular Expression Matching: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

# Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

#     '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
#     '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

# The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        return
