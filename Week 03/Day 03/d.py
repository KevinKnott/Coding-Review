#  Add Strings: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/

# Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
# You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.


class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:

        return
# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? 10
# Was the solution optimal? My initial is optimal for time but not space and the second one is fully optimal
# Were there any bugs? I forgot that I need to create a new node if the other two nodes didn't exist and we have a carry over
#  5 5 5 4 = 4.75
