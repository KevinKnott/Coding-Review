# Add Two Numbers II: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        return


# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? Y
# Was the solution optimal? N I didn't think of the quick select solution and I would still have to implement it
# Were there any bugs? Y my sorting took me a while to figure out my keys actually needed to be baseed off of count.get instead of count
#  4 3 3 2 = 3
