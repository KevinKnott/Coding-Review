# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/

# You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
# We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s, k):
        return
