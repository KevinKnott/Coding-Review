# Validate Binary Search Tree: https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

# A valid BST is defined as follows:

#     The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
#     The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
#     Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        return


# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
