# Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-sum-at-least-k/

# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of nums with a sum of at least k. If there is no such subarray, return -1.
# A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, nums, k: int) -> int:
        return
