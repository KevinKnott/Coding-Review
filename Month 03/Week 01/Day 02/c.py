# Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/

# You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.
# Return the number of connected components in the graph.

class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges) -> int:
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? Nope
# Did you finish within 30 min? 4 minutes
# Was the solution optimal? Yup this runs in o(n+m) time in worst case and uses o(1) space
# Were there any bugs? None
# 5 5 5 5 = 5
