# Count Binary Substrings: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/

# Give a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
# Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.


class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        return
