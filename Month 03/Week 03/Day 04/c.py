# Regular Expression Matching: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

# Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

# '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
# '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
# The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        return

# Did I need hints? Nope
# Did you finish within 30 min? 4 minutes
# Was the solution optimal? Yup this runs in o(n+m) time in worst case and uses o(1) space
# Were there any bugs? None
