# Add Two Numbers II: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

from types import Optional, List


# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        return
