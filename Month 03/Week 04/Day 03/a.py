# Reverse Nodes in k-Group: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

# Definition for singly-linked list.


class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
