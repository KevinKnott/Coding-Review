# Trapping Rain Water: https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height) -> int:
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
