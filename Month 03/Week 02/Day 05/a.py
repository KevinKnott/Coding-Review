# Palindrome Linked List: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/

# Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, headListNode) -> bool:
        return


# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
