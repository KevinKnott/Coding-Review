# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        return


# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? N (45 or so)
# Was the solution optimal? I believe so we could make some slight optimization but this will run in o(n^2) because of the multiplicity we would go through once and then again to multiply
#  and o(n) space
# Were there any bugs? I listed bugs in the above code
#  5 2 4 2 = 3.25
