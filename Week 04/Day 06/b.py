# Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/

# Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

# Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

# Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

#     It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
#     It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
#     It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        return
