# Reverse Nodes in k-Group: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/

# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.


# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        return
