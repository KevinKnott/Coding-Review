# Search in Rotated Sorted Array: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

# There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

# Prior to being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums, target):
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? Nope
# Did you finish within 30 min? 4 minutes
# Was the solution optimal? Yup this runs in o(n+m) time in worst case and uses o(1) space
# Were there any bugs? None
# 5 5 5 5 = 5
