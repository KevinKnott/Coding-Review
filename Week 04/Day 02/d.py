#  Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree: https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        return
