# Symmetric Tree: https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/

# Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
