#  Moving Average from Data Stream: https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/

# Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.
# Implement the MovingAverage class:

#     MovingAverage(int size) Initializes the object with the size of the window size.
#     double next(int val) Returns the moving average of the last size values of the stream.

class MovingAverage:

    def __init__(self, size: int):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        return

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        return


# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MovingAverage(size)
# param_1 = obj.next(val)

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N
# Did you finish within 30 min? Y
# Was the solution optimal? Y although you can read my blurb above about a potentially better solution it is rather complicated
# Were there any bugs? N
#  5 5 3 5 = 4.5
