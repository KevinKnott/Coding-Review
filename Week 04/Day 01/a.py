# Minimum Window Substring: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

# Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        return
