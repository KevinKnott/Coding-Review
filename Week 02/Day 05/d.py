# Basic Calculator: https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/
# Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
# Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().


class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s):
        return

# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N (But the second solution did)
# Did you finish within 30 min? Y
# Was the solution optimal? It is optimal enough, technically you can improve from o(E+V ) to o(e and the ackermanfunction(n)) and sapce could be just o(V) instead
# Were there any bugs? I did have one bug where I didn't add any nodes that were on there own like 0 in the example edges = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
# 4 5 3 3 =  3.75
