# Last Stone Weight: https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/
# We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

# Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

#     If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
#     If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.


class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones):
        return
