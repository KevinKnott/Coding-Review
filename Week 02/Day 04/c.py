# Score Card
# Did I need hints? N (But the second solution did)
# Did you finish within 30 min? No 1:30
# Was the solution optimal? My initial solution is optimal however I messed up the initial coding of it
# Were there any bugs? I forgot that since it is possible to have [[[[]]]] I need to actually recurse
#  4 1 2 1 = 2
